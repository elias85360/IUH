# Glossary (Dashboard & Platform)

- Device: Physical or logical asset producing telemetry (id, name, type, room, tags).
- Metric: Measured quantity. Defaults: U (V), I (A), P (W), E (Wh), F (Hz), pf, temp (°C), humid (%).
- KPI: Aggregate over a period (last, min, max, avg) computed per device/metric.
- Timeseries: Sequence of points { ts, value }. Optionally bucketized.
- Bucket / Bucketization: Group points by fixed-duration windows (e.g., 1 min, 1 h) and aggregate (avg/min/max/count).
- Baseline: Expected nominal range for a metric (used to colorize/compare). Configurable.
- Thresholds: Warn/Crit limits per metric (optionally per device), with direction (above/below).
- Anomaly (z‑score): Deviation from mean normalized by standard deviation. Threshold `anomalyZ` defines what’s flagged.
- Freshness: Age of the last point for a device/metric. Used in Data Health.
- Completeness: Ratio of observed buckets to expected buckets over the period.
- Gaps: Count of missing buckets in the period.
- Deadband: Ignore small changes within a tolerance to reduce alert flapping.
- Scene: Saved layout and filters for quick recall.
- Cross‑highlight: Shared hover cursor to align timestamps across charts.
- Socket.IO: WebSocket‑based realtime channel for live points/alerts.
- ETag: Cache validator header; the API returns weak ETags for timeseries/KPIs.
- RBAC: Role‑based access control (viewer/analyst/admin) enforced by the backend.
- OIDC: OpenID Connect (Keycloak) for authentication; the frontend uses PKCE code flow.
- JWT: JSON Web Token used as bearer token; verified with JWKS.
- Issuer / Audience: OIDC claims used to validate JWT origin and recipient.
- HMAC: Optional request signing (headers x-api-key-id, x-api-date, x-api-signature, x-api-nonce) to prevent replay.
- Rate limit: Backend throttle (window/max) with route-based exemptions for hot GETs.
- CSP/CORS: Security headers and cross-origin policy applied by nginx/dev server.
- Hypertable: TimescaleDB table optimized for time-series; supports continuous aggregates.
- Continuous aggregates (CAGGs): Materialized time-window aggregates refreshed periodically.
- Prometheus: Scrapes API metrics (counters/histograms) from `/metrics`.
- Grafana: Dashboards and alerts visualizing Prometheus data.
